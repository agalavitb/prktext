PRKTEXT

	A PRK conversion utility.

SYNOPSIS

	prktext park.PRK > output.txt

	prktext < input.txt

DESCRIPTION

	prktext translates THUG2 PRK files to and from text files.

	When it is called without arguments, a text file is read from the
	program's input and a PRK file with the same name as the park is written
	in the current working directory. If a file by the same name exists, it
	is overwritten.

	If it is called with an argument, the file referred to by the argument
	is opened and read as if it were a valid PRK file, and the corresponding
	text file is written to the program's output.
