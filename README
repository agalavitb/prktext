PRKTEXT

	A PRK conversion utility.

SYNOPSIS

	prktext park.PRK > output.txt

	prktext < input.txt

DESCRIPTION

	prktext translates THUG2 PRK files to and from text files.

	When it is called without arguments, a text file is read from the
	program's input and a PRK file with the same name as the park is written
	in the current working directory. If a file by the same name exists, it
	is overwritten.

	If it is called with an argument, the file referred to by the argument
	is opened and read as if it were a valid PRK file, and the corresponding
	text file is written to the program's output.

	$ prktext < example.txt
	# produces example.PRK

	$ prktext example.PRK
	# same as: cat example.txt

LIMITATIONS

	Goal data is not handled, although PRK files that contain goals can
	still be read, but when they're written back out the goals will be
	removed. There's just no way to represent goals, either in the file
	format or in the library.

	Parks that contain non-zero ground data outside of the designated square
	(25,25+8+8 in the example) will have those values dropped in the text
	representation. The library supports reading and writing those values,
	but the text format doesn't.
